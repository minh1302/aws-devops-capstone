## Project Overview

## Give your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers

In this project, you will prove your mastery of the following learning objectives:

- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.

### Instructions

* [Selling CI/CD](instructions/0-selling-cicd.md)
* [Getting Started](instructions/1-getting-started.md)
* [Deploying Working, Trustworthy Software](instructions/2-deploying-trustworthy-code.md)
* [Configuration Management](instructions/3-configuration-management.md)
* [Turn Errors into Sirens](instructions/4-turn-errors-into-sirens.md)

### Built With

- [Circle CI](www.circleci.com) - Cloud-based CI/CD service
- [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Cloud services
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) - Command-line tool for AWS
- [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) - Infrastrcuture as code
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) - Configuration management tool
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) - Monitoring tool


This project will apply the skills and knowledge of AWS Cloud DevOps . These include:

- Working in AWS
- Using Circle CI to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Building pipelines
- Working with Ansible and CloudFormation to deploy clusters
- Building Kubernetes clusters
- Building Docker containers in pipelines


Continuous Deployment will include:

- Pushing the built Docker container(s) to the Docker repository (AWS ECR, create custom Registry within cluster) ; 
- and
- Deploying these Docker container(s) to a small Kubernetes cluster (AWS Kubernetes as a Service). 
- To deploy your Kubernetes cluster, use either Ansible / Cloudformation. 

Run Continuous Deployment from Circle CI as an independent pipeline.

### Project Goal

- The Project goal is to operationalize this working, 
machine learning microservice using [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), 

- which is an open-source system for automating the management of containerized applications. 

In this project I will:
* Test  project code using linting
* Complete a Dockerfile to containerize this application
* Deploy containerized application using Docker and make a prediction
* Improve the log statements in the source code for this application
* Configure Kubernetes and create a Kubernetes cluster
* Deploy a container using Kubernetes and make a prediction
* Upload a complete Github repo with CircleCI to indicate that code has been tested

## Setup the Environment

* Create a virtualenv with Python 3.7 and activate it. Refer to this link for help on specifying the Python version in the virtualenv. 
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
# You should have Python 3.7 available in your host. 
# Check the Python path using `which python3`
# Use a command similar to this one:
python3 -m virtualenv --python=<path-to-Python3.7> .devops
source .devops/bin/activate
```
* Run `make install` to install the necessary dependencies

### Running `app.py`

1. Standalone:  `python app.py`
2. Run in Docker:  `./run_docker.sh`
3. Run in Kubernetes:  `./run_kubernetes.sh`

### Kubernetes Steps

* Setup and Configure Docker locally
You will need to use Docker to build and upload a containerized application. If you already have this installed and created a docker account, you may skip this step.

1. You???ll need to [create a free docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup), where you???ll choose a unique username and link your email to a docker account. 
Your username is your unique docker ID.

2. To install the latest version of docker, choose the Community Edition (CE) for your operating system, on [docker???s installation site](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/).
It is also recommended that you install the latest, stable release:

3. After installation, you can verify that you???ve successfully installed docker by printing its version in your terminal: 
```bash
docker --version

* Setup and Configure Kubernetes locally
To run a Kubernetes cluster locally, for testing and project purposes, you need the Kubernetes package, Minikube. 

This operates in a virtual machine and so you will need to download two things: 
    A virtual machine (aka a hypervisor) then minikube. 
    
Thorough installation instructions can be found here. 
Here is how I installed minikube:

1. Install VirtualBox:
    For Mac & Linux:
```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
```
For Windows, I recommend using a [Windows host](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

2. Install minikube:
    For Mac & Linux:
```bash
brew cask install minikube
```
For Windows, I recommend using the [Windows installer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

3. Configure Kubernetes to Run Locally

You should have a virtual machine like VirtualBox and minikube installed, 
as per the project environmet instructions. To start a local cluster, type the terminal command: 
```bash
minikube start.
```

After minikube starts, a cluster should be running locally. 
You can check that you have one cluster running by typing ```kubectl config view``` where you should see at least one cluster with a certificate-authority and server.

This is a short task, but it may take some time to configure Kubernetes, and so this deserves its own task number.

### Create Flask app in Container

Complete the following steps to get Docker running locally

1. Step 1: Build image and add a descriptive tag
docker build -t minh1302/udacity-project-3 .

2. Step 2:  List docker images
docker image ls

3. Step 3:  Run flask app
docker run -p 8000:80 minh1302/udacity-project-3

### Run via kubectl

#### Deploy with Kubernetes and Save Output Logs

Now that you???ve uploaded a docker image and configured Kubernetes so that a cluster is running, 
you???ll be able to deploy your application on the Kubernetes cluster. 

This involves running your containerized application using kubectl, 
which is a command line interface for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
```run_kubernetes.sh```

To deploy this application using kubectl, 
open and complete the file, run_kubernetes.sh:

The steps will be somewhat similar to what you did in both run_docker.sh and upload_docker.sh 
but specific to kubernetes clusters. 
Within run_kubernetes.sh, complete the following steps:


#### Define a dockerpath which will be ???/path???
this should be the same name as your uploaded repository (the same as in upload_docker.sh)

#### Run the docker container with kubectl; 
you???ll have to specify the container and the port

#### List the kubernetes pods
Forward the container port to a host port, using the same ports as before
After completing the code, call the script ./run_kubernetes.sh. 
This assumes you have a local cluster configured and running. 
This script should create a pod with a name you specify and you may get an initial output 

#### Initially, your pod may be in the process of being created, 
as indicated by STATUS: ContainerCreating, 
but you just have to wait a few minutes until the pod is ready, then you can run the script again.

#### Waiting: You can check on your pod???s status with a call 
to kubectl get pod and you should see the status change to Running. 
Then you can run the full ./run_kuberenets.sh script again.

#### Make a prediction
After you???ve called run_kubernetes.sh, and a pod is up and running, make a prediction using a separate terminal tab, 
and a call to ./make_prediction.sh, as you did before.
